Add streaming support for large diffs in flux/core/diff.py

PROBLEM:
display_compact_diff() loads entire diff into memory (line 203 and 223).
For very large files, this can cause memory issues.

SOLUTION:
Add a new method display_streamed_diff() that yields diff lines instead of loading all at once.

ADD THIS NEW METHOD to DiffPreview class in flux/core/diff.py:

def display_streamed_diff(
    self,
    original: str,
    modified: str,
    filename: str = "file",
    chunk_size: int = 100
):
    """Display diff in chunks to handle large files.
    
    Args:
        original: Original file content
        modified: Modified file content  
        filename: Name of file being diffed
        chunk_size: Number of diff lines to show per chunk
    """
    # Generate diff as iterator (not list)
    original_lines = original.splitlines(keepends=True)
    modified_lines = modified.splitlines(keepends=True)
    
    diff_iter = difflib.unified_diff(
        original_lines,
        modified_lines,
        fromfile=f"a/{filename}",
        tofile=f"b/{filename}",
        lineterm=''
    )
    
    # Stream chunks
    chunk = []
    total_lines = 0
    
    for line in diff_iter:
        chunk.append(line)
        
        if len(chunk) >= chunk_size:
            # Display this chunk
            self._display_diff_chunk(chunk, total_lines)
            total_lines += len(chunk)
            chunk = []
    
    # Display final chunk
    if chunk:
        self._display_diff_chunk(chunk, total_lines)

def _display_diff_chunk(self, lines: List[str], start_line: int):
    """Display a chunk of diff lines.
    
    Args:
        lines: List of diff lines to display
        start_line: Starting line number for this chunk
    """
    colored = []
    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith('+++') or line.startswith('---'):
            colored.append(f"[bold cyan]{line}[/bold cyan]")
        elif line.startswith('+'):
            colored.append(f"[green]{line}[/green]")
        elif line.startswith('-'):
            colored.append(f"[red]{line}[/red]")
        elif line.startswith('@@'):
            colored.append(f"[bold blue]{line}[/bold blue]")
        else:
            colored.append(f"[dim]{line}[/dim]")
    
    self.console.print("\\n".join(colored))
    
    if start_line > 0:
        self.console.print(f"[dim]... showing lines {start_line}-{start_line + len(lines)}[/dim]")

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read flux/core/diff.py to understand DiffPreview class
2. Use edit_file to add display_streamed_diff method after display_compact_diff method
3. Use edit_file to add _display_diff_chunk helper method after display_streamed_diff

DO NOT use ast_edit (this is Python but edit_file is more reliable for adding methods).
